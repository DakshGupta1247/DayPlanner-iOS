# PlanDay — iOS Day Trip Planner

A smart personal day-trip planner built with SwiftUI and MapKit.

Plan a day visiting multiple places → get a GPS-aware optimised route → follow a live itinerary → navigate stop by stop.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Usage |
|---|---|
| **SwiftUI** | All UI, declarative layout, iOS 17+ |
| **MapKit + MKDirections** | Maps, routing, polylines, place search |
| **CoreLocation / CLLocationManager** | Real-time GPS tracking, permission handling |
| **Swift async/await** | All async calls — no Combine anywhere |
| **@Observable (iOS 17)** | ViewModels and Services use the new macro |
| **FileManager + JSON** | Per-profile trip persistence in Documents folder |
| **@AppStorage / UserDefaults** | Settings, onboarding flag, profiles list |
| **UserNotifications** | Local reminders (evening before + morning of each plan) |

## Architecture

MVVM — each screen has its own `View` + `ViewModel`. Services are `@Observable` singletons.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Per-profile persistence** — each profile has its own `history_<uuid>.json`; switching profiles auto-loads that profile's data
- **Upsert by ID** — `TripHistoryService.save()` replaces existing records by matching ID, so editing never creates duplicates
- **GPS as invisible stop #0** — when permission is granted, the user's current location is used as the origin for nearest-neighbour optimisation so Stop #1 is always the closest stop to where the user is
- **MinHeap for O(n log n) routing** — nearest-neighbour uses a binary min-heap instead of linear scan
- **`Color.hex()` static func** — avoids conflict with iOS 26's new `Color(hex: Int)` initialiser
- **No Combine** — all async work uses Swift's native `async/await`
- **`isVisited` excluded from Codable** — `Stop.isVisited` is a transient runtime flag; excluded via `CodingKeys` so existing saved JSON never breaks
- **`.preferredColorScheme` on root** — applied at `SplashScreenView` (the true app root) and on every sheet so theme changes apply instantly everywhere
- **`LocationProviding` protocol** — abstracts GPS so both `LocationService` (real GPS) and `GPXReplayProvider` (simulator replay) work identically with all ViewModels
- **`AppEnvironment.locationProvider`** — single `#if DEBUG` switch; simulator always gets `GPXReplayProvider`, device always gets `LocationService`
- **Single `AsyncStream` consumer** — `LiveNavigationViewModel` uses one `for await` loop for all location events; dual consumers caused stream starvation and missed arrival detections
- **`routeCalcInFlight` flag** — prevents `MKDirections.calculate()` from being cancelled mid-flight on every GPS tick; only one route request runs at a time

## Running the App

1. Open `DayPlanner/DayPlanner.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+
2. Select a Simulator (iPhone 16 Pro recommended) or your iPhone
3. Press `Cmd+R`

> **GPS Testing in Simulator:** Debug → Simulate Location → pick a city, or Features → Location → Custom Location in the simulator window.

> **Live Navigation (FR9):** Full GPS tracking works best on a real device.

## How to Run the GPX Demo

> GPX replay works on both Simulator and real device in DEBUG builds (run from Xcode). On a Release build, live GPS is used automatically.

### Steps

1. Build and run on iPhone/iPad Simulator (or real device via Xcode)

2. On the Home Screen, tap the blue **"Load Delhi Demo Plan"** banner
   → 6 Delhi landmarks load instantly
   → Route Optimizer opens automatically

3. Tap **"Optimise Route"**
   → Stops reorder by nearest-neighbour order: CP → India Gate → Humayun's Tomb → Lotus Temple → Qutub Minar → Red Fort
   → Blue polyline appears on map

4. Tap **"Start Day"**
   → GPX replay begins automatically (~5s per dot movement at 6× speed)
   → Blue dot starts moving through Delhi
   → Live polyline + ETA appears within ~5–10 seconds
   → Progress bar shows "Stop 1 of 6" + "0 completed"
   → Trust chip shows 🟢 GPS Good

5. When the dot gets within 100m of a stop:
   → Green "You've arrived!" banner slides in from top
   → Tap "Mark Arrived" → stop card updates, "Next: India Gate" toast slides in

6. Repeat for all 6 stops → Day Complete screen with confetti appears

### Stops in the Demo Route (GPX order)

| # | Place | Closes |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Connaught Place | 21:00 |
| 2 | India Gate | 22:00 |
| 3 | Humayun's Tomb | 18:00 |
| 4 | Lotus Temple | 17:30 |
| 5 | Qutub Minar | 17:00 |
| 6 | Red Fort | 17:30 |

### Debug Bypass Note

The `#if DEBUG` flag in `AppEnvironment.swift` automatically switches between:
- **DEBUG (Xcode run)** → `GPXReplayProvider` (fake GPS from `demo-route.gpx`, 6× speed)
- **Release build** → `LocationService` (real live GPS)

No manual configuration needed.
